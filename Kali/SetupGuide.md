üîß Complete Kali Linux Setup Guide
Setting up Kali Linux from scratch for TarbhTech

üìã Prerequisites

A computer or virtual machine ready for installation
Kali Linux ISO downloaded and burned to USB
Basic understanding that you'll be erasing the target drive


üöÄ Installation Process
Step 1: Boot and Initial Setup

Boot from your Kali Linux installation media
Select "Graphical Install" from the boot menu

This provides an easier, visual installation process



Step 2: Language and Location Settings

Language Selection

Choose: English


Country Selection

Choose: Ireland


Keyboard Layout

Choose: British English
This matches Irish keyboard layouts



Step 3: Network Configuration

Network Interface Selection

Choose your network interface:

eth0 (for wired ethernet connection)
wlan0 (for wireless connection)


If using wireless, you'll need to enter WiFi credentials


Hostname Configuration

Hostname: Enter your device name (this will be displayed on the network)
Example: kali-laptop, pentest-01, etc.


Domain Name (Optional)

Leave blank unless you're part of a specific domain
Most home/office setups can skip this



Step 4: User Account Setup

Username Creation

Username: TarbhTech
This will be your primary user account


Password Setup

Create a strong password for the TarbhTech user
Important: Remember this password - you'll need it frequently



Step 5: Disk Partitioning

Partitioning Method

Select: Use entire disk
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This will erase everything on the selected drive


Disk Selection

Choose your SSD from the list of available drives
Double-check you're selecting the correct drive


Partition Structure

Select: Separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions
This provides better security and performance:

/home - User files and data
/var - System logs and variable data
/tmp - Temporary files




Review Partition Structure

The installer will show you the partition layout
Review carefully, then click Continue


Confirm Changes

Click Yes to "Write changes to disks"
‚ö†Ô∏è Final warning: This is your last chance before data is erased



Step 6: Desktop Environment Selection

Software Selection

IMPORTANT: Only select XFCE Desktop Environment
Uncheck all other desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
Having multiple desktop environments can cause system instability


Complete Installation

Wait for the installation to complete
The system will reboot automatically

üîê Tailscale Configuration
Tailscale creates a secure private network between your devices. You can either set it up manually or use an authentication token for automated setup.
Method 1: Manual Setup
After installing Tailscale, authenticate manually:

Start Tailscale:
bashsudo tailscale up

Follow the authentication link that appears in the terminal
Sign in to your Tailscale account in your web browser
Authorize the device when prompted

Method 2: Automated Setup with Auth Token (Recommended)
How to Generate an Auth Token:

Log in to Tailscale Admin Console:

Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
Sign in with your Tailscale account


Generate Auth Key:

Click "Generate auth key"
Settings to configure:

‚úÖ Reusable: Check this if you plan to use it on multiple devices
‚úÖ Ephemeral: Check this for temporary devices (optional)
‚è±Ô∏è Expiry: Set expiration time (default is 90 days)
üè∑Ô∏è Tags: Add device tags if needed (optional)




Copy the Auth Key:

Copy the generated key (starts with tskey-auth-)
Store it securely - it won't be shown again



Using the Auth Token:
Replace YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token:
bashcurl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh && sudo tailscale up --auth-key=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
Example (‚ö†Ô∏è This token is example only):
bashcurl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh && sudo tailscale up --auth-key=tskey-auth-kdtTw8Vpoo11CNTRL-UesqkEzczsbCPpS4hxTKqb4EQnUu1TjW
Verify Tailscale Connection
After setup, verify Tailscale is working:
bashsudo tailscale status
You should see your device listed with an IP address (usually starts with 100.x.x.x).
